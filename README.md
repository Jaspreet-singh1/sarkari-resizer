## ✨ Key Features
- **Modern Premium UI**: "ExamMint" style dashboard with split-screen layout (Desktop) and mobile-optimized vertical stack.

- **PWA Ready**: Works offline and can be installed as an app.
- **Mobile First**: Optimized for low-end Android devices and poor network conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism UI), JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Libraries**: `jspdf` (for image-to-PDF conversion).
- **Hosting**: Static Hosting (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages).
