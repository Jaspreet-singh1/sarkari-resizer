## 🚀 About
Sarkari Resizer is a privacy-first, client-side web application designed to help candidates resize their **Photos and Signatures** to strict government requirements (e.g., 20KB - 50KB for SSC/UPSC) without losing visual clarity.

**Live URL:** [https://sarkariresizer.app](https://sarkariresizer.app)

- **Cheat Sheet**: Built-in size guide for SSC, UPSC, IBPS, Railways, and more.
- **PWA Ready**: Works offline and can be installed as an app.
- **Mobile First**: Optimized for low-end Android devices and poor network conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism UI), JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Libraries**: `jspdf` (for image-to-PDF conversion).
- **Hosting**: Static Hosting (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages).
- **Analytics**: Google Search Console & Hosting Logs.
